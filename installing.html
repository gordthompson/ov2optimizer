<h3>System requirements: </h3>
<ul>
<li>
	<p>
	I tested ov2optimizer under Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, and it worked fine for me. If you have problems please let me know.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>
	If your machine does not already have .NET Framework 3.5 on it then you may have to manually install that on older versions of Windows. (Windows 8 should prompt you to download and install it automatically if required.)
	</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Installation Notes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
		If you run the installer and your computer pops up a message saying "Windows SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk." you need to click the "More info" link and then choose "Run anyway".
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
	A few users have reported that Symantec/Norton security products flag the installer as potential malware ("WS.Reputation.1", meaning "I haven't heard of this app before") and delete it. I submitted a request to have the installer whitelisted and the request was denied. If those products do not offer a "Run anyway" option then you could either temporarily disable them during the install, or use a better anti-virus/security product.
